# Breast-Cancer-Classification-and-Segmentation

Two of the most prominent real time usages of machine learning algorithms are in Classification and Segmentation.
Classification is the process of categorizing a given set of data into classes, which are often referred to as targets, labels or categories. It can be performed on both structured or unstructured data. Segmentation, or more importantly Image Segmentation is the art of partitioning an image into multiple smaller segments or groups
of pixels, such that each pixel in the digital image has a specific label assigned to it. This project aims to delve deeper into these concepts and understand in detail their functionalities, similarities and differences by solving a real-time issue, one involving the recognition and isolation of tumors in breast cells, using both classification and segmentation sequentially.
